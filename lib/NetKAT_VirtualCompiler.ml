  out_fabric/in_fabric have to be of the form
     UNION_{vl : Vloc}{
      match_vloc vl; UNION_{pl : Ploc}{
        match_ploc pl; path(vl, pl)
      }
    }
  where path(vl, pl) is a path in the physical topology ending with a link
    (i) going out of pl in the case of out_fabric, or
    (ii) going into pl in the case of in_fabric
  
  Note that the framework allows out_fabric/in_fabric to be specified by hand in NetKAT,
  but we could also generate them automatically, e.g. from a virtualization relation and
  the physical topology using Dijkstra.

 ---------------------------

  Vingress defines the virtual ingress. Examples:

   1) The physical ingress is {(1,1)} (i.e. packets can enter the network only
      through port 1 of switch 1), and we want packets to enter the virtual network
      at vport 3 of vswitch 3. This is encoded as
        vingress =
          vswitch := 3; vport := 3

   2) The physical ingress is {(1,1), (2,2)} (i.e. packets can enter the network only
      through port 1 of switch 1 and port 2 of switch 2),
      and we want packets to enter the virtual network
      at vport 3 of vswitch 3. This is encoded as
        vingress =
          vswitch := 3; vport := 3

   3) The physical ingress is {(1,1)} and we want packets to enter the virtual network
      at both vport 3 of vswitch 3 and vport 4 of switch 4. This is encoded as
        vingress =
          (vswitch := 3; vport := 3) + (vswitch := 4; vport := 4)

   4) The physical ingress is {(1,1), (2,2)} and we want packets from (1,1) to
      enter the virtual network at vport 3 of vswitch 3, and packet from (2,2)
      shall enter at vport 4 of vswitch 4. This is encoded as
        vingress =
          switch = 1; port = 1; vswitch := 3; vport := 3
        + switch = 2; port = 2; vswitch := 4; vport := 4

   5) I just realized that the framework can even handle more complicated virtual ingress
      specifications as the ones Arjun mentioned in our last meeting, e.g.
        vingress =
          IPProto = tcp; vswitch := 1; vport := 1
        + IPProto = ucp; vswitch := 2; vport := 1
      This is super awesome!!

   
  To gurantee correctness we will have to do some sort of "type checking", i.e. we have to make sure
  certain pre conditions are met.
